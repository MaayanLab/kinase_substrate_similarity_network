# Kinase Substrate Similarity Network
An example visualization of a kinase-substrate similarity network (data obtained from the [Harmoniziome](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome/dataset/KEA+Substrates+of+Kinases) and [Uniprot](http://www.uniprot.org/)) as a similarity matrix built using the [Clustergrammer](https://github.com/MaayanLab/clustergrammer) visualization web-tool.
